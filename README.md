# Thermin.js
Thermin.js is an easily extendable and simple-to-incorporate jQuery plugin for a [theremin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theremin). It is controlled by mouse position, where the x-axis is pitch and the y-axis is volume. 
## Usage
Therminjs is really easy to implement, simply include the `thermin.js` flie after jQurey in your document. Select any jQuery object and call `.Thermin()` on it. There are a few options you can alter when initializing, but the defaults are pretty standard.
